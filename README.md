## [Description](#table-of-contents)
A solid understanding of object-relational mapping is integral for any software developer due to the breadth of itâ€™s application across all of the tech industry.  Complex database creation, seeding and manipulation is the backbone of the largest sector of tech, e-commerce, also known as internet retail. The E-Commerce Back End application uses express.js, mysql2, sequelize, dotenv and nodemon to create the server-side of an e-commerce website, and insomnia to test the api routes built.

## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
- The command `npm i` will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file. 
- Update the .env file with your MySQL password then remove the "Example" from the file name. 
- `mysql -uroot -p` followed by your personal password, to log in to your MySQL account. 
- `source db/schema.sql;` will build the database. 
- `quit;` to exit MySQL and enter `npm run seed` in your CLI to seed the database. 
- After successful seeding, `npm start` will launch your application in localhost:3001// for testing routes within Insomnia.

## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
The application is intended to be used as a simple starter code for any back-end e-commerce website. Seeding data and routes will need to be updated for intended use and the front-end of the website built prior to the website launching.
